1) Add fall-back action: Currently if I go try to order a taco,
the robot won't pick-up that that is a main-entree because it looks so 
different. In general we need a fall back action to capture any edge 
cases and handle unexpected input with a robot response like: "Uhhh 
I don't understand" or something generic.


2) Add chit-chat: This would be so if we are entering a form or a story,
the mechanism is in place if a user starts talking about their day or
the weather. I'm not too sure on what this looks like right now.

3) Add another conversation thread (story) associated with something
like the user asking "what's good here?", "how much is X?" etc. This
would be handled in a general FAQ type story

4) Possibly add side implementation or upsell idea.

5) Add ability to calculate cost. This would be a custom action so start
with actions.py

6) Add validation for the drink entree. This would be in actions.py.

7) Add desert slot, entity. Add that into the current form and the current rule. Then add validation for it in actions.py
